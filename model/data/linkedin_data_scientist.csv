You are not replacing any member of staff, but helping alongside them, whilst learning new skills. Benefits   Gain knowledge and practical skills in shark research, education and conservation.   Ideal for volunteers with an interest in science, getting their feet wet, assisting with a dive centre and spreading the word about shark conservation, and there is also a chance to learn how to get GoPro footage of sharks under the water.   Cage-less snorkeling with upto 5 species of shark   Keywords: Scuba, free diving , shark conservation, SCUBA centre, science, research, education   Participants will become crucial members of our teams as we strive to complete our mission of shark ecotourism, research, conservation and education. The program is jammed with shark activities from conducting ongoing research programs into the  health of shark populations  on Aliwal Shoal, to assisting and supporting tourists as we introduce them to the underwater world for the first time. The program is located at the world famous  Aliwal Shoal , where volunteers will be working with unto five different species of sharks and a host of other marine life. The program is divided into four sections, on which volunteers will work on a daily basis. These include  (a) shark research, (b) awareness and outreach, (c) shark and marine conservation and (d) shark ecotourism . The program is designed to cover a broad range of fields, so as to allow volunteers to discover their passion and build towards a career working with sharks and marine life. If students are not SCUBA qualified, then the first week of the program can be used to gain a PADI open water SCUBA certification. SCUBA qualified volunteers can expect between 4 and 8 research SCUBA dives per month. Blacktip sharks (throughout the year) This part of the project involves taking part in ocean safaris to snorkel with black-tip sharks as well as taking underwater photographs for identifying the sharks and recording ecological information. The type of information collected include date, GPS location, surface and underwater conditions, size, sex, distinctive features, behaviour of the sharks. The ID photographs help identify each shark and record re-sightings. In addition, volunteers will be an integral part of the ecotourism trips, aiding, photographing and videoing clients during our shark snorkels. Ragged tooth sharks (May - September) Our research project is open to SCUBA qualified volunteers (as raggedtooths are a benthic species). You will be collecting similar data which allows their numbers and behaviour to be recorded and uploaded into databases to determine intern annual variations. Furthermore, shark behaviour and movements is of particular interest as it relates to tourism and the diving industry in South Africa. Tiger Shark (February - April) Tiger shark monitoring involves joining scuba diving and carrying out underwater data collection on this shy species. On occasion film crews will require working with Tiger sharks, and volunteers may be called on to aid in these expeditions. Humpback Whales (June October) You may help with monitoring the numbers of humpback whales during their seasonal migration. You will participate in sand dune based observations with binoculars, boat based observations to record the number of whales, observing their behaviour. General environment (throughout the year) A more general environmental awareness and clean-up activities include collecting information during field work, collating it in a computer database on-site and online, uploading some data onto an international database where international contributors can access it and use for scientific journals and theses. Your work will also include biodiversity assessments and environmental monitoring. Oceans user surveys are occasionally undertaken. General Education ( throughout the year ) Participants will assist with our central conservation and awareness campaigns that range from raising awareness to social activism. There are school outreach programs; shark diving-guest education and social media awareness campaigns. General Crewing ( throughout the year ) Participants will assist with preparing the equipment for the daily ocean outings.They will also be able to learn how to video and photograph guests interacting with the sharks. Most satisfying however is that participants will engage directly with guests, teaching them about sharks and ensuring that the guests are comfortable throughout the activity and leave having learned a great deal about the importance of sharks. Daily Life Our staff will welcome you at Durban Airport and transfer you to your accommodation. Your second day will start with a presentation by the co-ordinating scientist and this which will prepare you for the various projects. After that you will get an introduction to Scottburgh town, a small coastal holiday town that is opposite the Aliwal Shoal. You may start your open water scuba diving course ( if you arent already certified), which will last between 3 and 5 days depending on the conditions. Volunteers not involved in SCUBA training will begin the program activities immediately. Daily life will be centre around early morning sea expeditions. Many of this will be ecotourism trips with clients to snorkel or SCUBA dive with sharks. On these morning trips, volunteers will be allocated roles, including collecting research data, assisting clients, crew assistance, videography or photography. After the morning trips, volunteers will engage with clients on our outreach program to ensure that all guests leave as aware shark ambassadors. Afternoons will be spent entering research data, conducting training classes (e.g. boat maintenance, SCUBA maintenance, briefing training, editing training, etc.) or partaking in further education (school visits) or conservation (beach cleanups, awareness drives) programs. Throughout the month, dedicated days to research, education and conservation programs will also take place. Where volunteers and the coordinating scientist will conduct exclusive trips to drive these programs. These can include biodiversity assessments, shark research SCUBA dives, school trips, conservation campaigns. Volunteers will also have between one and two days a week off. During these off days volunteers are welcome to relax, swim, surf, or participate in organized trips to experience adventures throughout the region.
