Sales and Merchandising: Demand and audience forecasting/projections:  Data Science Skills Required: Multi-regression algorithms (neural networks, gradient-boosted trees, other appropriate algorithms)  Time-dependent probability distribution modeling  Operations/Supply Chain: Optimal resource allocation/scheduling, workflow automation, infrastructure rationalization  In-depth knowledge of solving optimization problems: linear and non-linear programming using KKT, Lagrange multipliers and similar methods. In particular, such problems will require using data science/machine learning methodologies  in combination  with implementing numerical solvers for various optimization problems.     Qualifications     Software / Technology Skills Required  To be successful in this role, the data scientists will need to have in-depth knowledge of existing industry-standard ML platforms such as R and Python, and AI platforms built in these environments such as: Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), Keras and PyTorch. Further, to solve optimization problems, the data scientist should have knowledge of numerical solvers available in R such as  optim()  and  optimx(),  and have knowledge of solving optimization problems in Mathematica and/or MATLAB.  Further, it must be recognized that this position involves being at the fore-front of new technologies in the ML/AI world. Since most of our data science projects are based off Microsoft technologies such as ML Server (Python Server + R Server) which are increasingly being implemented in successive versions of SQL Server and PowerBI, the data scientist will have to constantly be up-to-date with these latest trends and implementations.  Working With Other Members of The Analytics Team  The current analytics team consists of experts in data visualization/interaction, data engineers who maintain the data structures and queries in SQL Server and who operationalize the R/Python scripts for large-scale production, and a forecasting and pricing analytics expert.  This role will involve continuous and close collaboration with all of the aforementioned groups. In particular, the main role of the Principal Data Scientist will be to prototype/design algorithms, and implement them using the appropriate software libraries. They will then work closely with the database/data engineering team to implement these algorithms for “productionalization” so that they can be run “at scale” and on a regular schedule. The data scientist will also make use of live data provided by this team to build algorithms that can make use of live data for the most accurate models possible.  This role will also involve close collaboration with the forecasting and pricing analytics data scientist. In particular, this role will function in two ways. Part of the time, the forecasting and pricing analytics data scientist will design a forecasting model of which the Principal Data Scientist will then help to implement in a “big data” setting in an efficient manner. The role will also function in the opposite direction as well. The Principal Data Scientist will also design/implement forecasting models which the forecasting and pricing analytics data scientist will manage and maintain on a regular basis.  Finally, this role will involve close collaboration with the data visualization team who will be responsible for implementing the user interface behind the various ML solutions for business consumption. This will either be in the form of the principal data scientist being responsible for handing over data in the form of tables in SQL Server of which the visualization team will make dashboards in PowerBI “from scratch” or taking over a rough dashboard/visualization created by the Principal Data Scientist to make it more appropriate for wide business consumption.  Additional Information     Interested applicants please apply today.  While we appreciate all interest, only those candidates selected for an interview will be contacted. As part of Cineplex Entertainment’s standard recruitment process, suitable candidate(s) will be required to undergo pre-employment screening as a condition of employment or promotion.

With a 50% failure rate, inappropriate antibodies waste millions of research dollars and delay novel therapies by months. BenchSci’s AI solves this problem by continuously reading biomedical papers like a PhD biologist to understand which antibodies have been successfully used in which experiments. Unlike traditional antibody search tools, BenchSci uses comprehensive data, proprietary machine learning models, sophisticated bioinformatics and ontologies, proprietary image recognition technology, and a unique interface to increase confidence in antibody selection. This reduces the cost of research and increases its impact for over 31,000 scientists at more than 3,600 academic institutions and 15 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies that trust BenchSci to guide their experiment design.
